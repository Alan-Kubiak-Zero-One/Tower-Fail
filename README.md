# Early prototype of Breaking The Tower game.

This is the early prototype of Breaking The Tower from Markus Notch Persson.

I had to dig deep into the wayback machine to get this one, this is a very cool
test for the game, some kind of spacial simulation before making the tower.

It is seen in the making of the tower livestream in the beginning.

As i've seen in the source, the game function is very mathematical! using matrix
and emulating a 3D environment with only vectors, too cool!

As always all the rights are from Notch, i have adapted the last version, enjoy this
simulation.
